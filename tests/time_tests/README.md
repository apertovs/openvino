# Time Tests

This test suite contains pipelines, which are executables. The pipelines measure
the time of their execution, both total and partial. A Python runner calls the
pipelines and calcuates the average execution time.

## Prerequisites

To build the time tests, you need to have the `build` folder, which is created
when you configure and build OpenVINOâ„¢.

## Measure Time

To build and run the tests, open a terminal and run the commands below:

1. Build tests:
``` bash
cmake .. -DInferenceEngineDeveloperPackage_DIR=../../../build && make time-tests
```

2. Run test:
``` bash
./run_executable.py ../../../bin/intel64/Release/timetest_infer -m model.xml -d CPU
```
